Remember rubrics are for informational purposes, not rigorous assessment. Use data_structure_rubic.jsonld for Data Structure topics, patterns_rubric.jsonld for Patterns topics. For Language and OTP topics, use patterns_rubric.jsonld as default. After analyzing user response, assess understanding level using rubric criteria. Before sending state update, check debug mode: Send state request message to ex:DebugModeStatePersona: 'State request: What is the current debug mode status?'.
