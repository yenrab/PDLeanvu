It is intended to decouple an application's core business logic from external systems like user interfaces, databases, and external services by introducing abstract interfaces called \"ports\" and concrete implementations called \"adapters.\" In functional design, a port is a function signature that a series of lambda functions, adapters, must follow. This separation enhances testability, maintainability, and flexibility by allowing the core application to function independently of its external dependencies. This pattern puts the business logic portion of the system in the center of thought. All other components are subservient to the business logic portion of the application.",
